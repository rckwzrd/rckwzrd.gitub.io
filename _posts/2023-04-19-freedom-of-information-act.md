The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a federal law designed to facilitate transparancy in government. It was enacted in the 1960s under President Lyndon B Johnson and focuses on executive branch federal agencies. The FOIA requires the proactive posting of information and the timely release of information when requested. The FOIA also makes distinctions between public and protected records. Notes below cover FOIA basics.
